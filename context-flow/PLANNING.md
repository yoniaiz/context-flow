Part 1: Strategic Vision & System Architecture
1.1 The Discipline of Context Engineering
The quality of an AI's output is directly proportional to the quality of the context it is given. This framework elevates the practice of assembling this information into a formal discipline: Context Engineering.

To establish a clear vocabulary, we distinguish between two fundamental types of context:

Intent Context: The user's goal or desired future state (e.g., the prompt, "Refactor this function").

State Context: The descriptive, raw material the model needs to operate (e.g., source code, error logs, API schemas).

The framework's mission is to empower developers to master the creation and management of high-fidelity State Context. This leads to our core architectural philosophy: a "context definition" must be treated as a first-class, composable, and executable artifact. It is a reusable "recipe" that can be built, versioned in Git, shared, and executed programmatically.

Product Vision: The Context Engineering Framework will be an extensible system for developers to define, compose, version, and execute context configurations. It will feature a powerful CLI, an intuitive visual builder, and a robust plugin model, creating a "React-like component ecosystem for context."

1.2 High-Level System Architecture
The system is designed with a modular, decoupled architecture to maximize flexibility and maintainability.

Context Engine (@context/core): The heart of the system. A self-contained TypeScript library responsible for parsing definition files, resolving providers, and assembling the final context payload.

CLI (context-cli): The primary interface for developers and automation, built in TypeScript using the oclif framework for its powerful plugin architecture.

Provider API (@context/provider-api): A formal TypeScript interface that third-party context providers must implement, enabling the framework's extensibility.

Visual Context Builder: A desktop application built with Tauri and React Flow that provides a rich graphical interface for composing context definitions.

LSP Server (@context/lsp): A Language Server Protocol (LSP) server to provide rich, in-editor features like autocompletion and real-time validation for configuration files.

1.3 Core User Personas
The framework is designed to serve several key developer personas:

The AI Power User: Lives in the terminal, values speed and scriptability. Uses the CLI to rapidly assemble and pipe context into LLM tools.

The Platform Engineer: Focuses on creating reusable, version-controlled context templates for their organization. Leverages the plugin architecture to build custom, internal context providers.

The Application Developer: New to context engineering, they use the Visual Builder to discover providers and interactively compose context definitions, learning the core concepts through an intuitive graphical interface.

Part 2: The Core Engine: Configuration & Extensibility
This section details the intellectual property of the framework: the system for defining, sourcing, and composing context.

2.1 Configuration Language: TOML
To make context definitions portable and versionable, they must be declared in a configuration file. TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) is the optimal choice.

While YAML is familiar, its reliance on significant whitespace and ambiguous type coercion makes it prone to subtle configuration bugs. JSON lacks comments, making it unsuitable for human-authored files. TOML was specifically designed for configuration, offering a clear, unambiguous syntax that is easy to read and write, minimizing cognitive load and user error.

The framework will use two types of files:

component.toml: Defines a reusable, single-purpose context "component."

workflow.toml: Composes multiple components and providers into a complete context payload for a specific task.

An example component.toml file:

Ini, TOML

# component.toml

# A unique, machine-readable identifier for the component.
name = "RunProjectTests"
description = "A component that provides the test file and testing framework configuration."

# Defines the inputs (props) for this component.
[inputs.framework]
  description = "The testing framework to use (e.g., 'jest', 'vitest')."
  type = "string"
  required = true

[inputs.testFilePath]
  description = "Path to the specific test file to run."
  type = "string"
  required = true
  default = "src/app.test.ts"

# The template that forms the body of the context rule.
# It uses the @provider syntax to call context providers.
template = """
Here is the test file located at {{ inputs.testFilePath }}:
{{ @file(inputs.testFilePath) }}

The project uses the '{{ inputs.framework }}' testing framework.
"""
2.2 Schema and Validation: Zod
To ensure all configuration files are valid and provide strong type safety, Zod will be used as the schema definition and validation engine. Zod's key advantage is its ability to infer a static TypeScript type directly from a runtime validation schema. This makes the Zod schema the single source of truth for both the shape and the type of the configuration data, eliminating type drift between validation logic and application code.

2.3 The Context Provider Model
The framework's extensibility hinges on a well-defined plugin architecture for sourcing context, inspired by the "Context Provider" concept in tools like Continue.dev. A new package, @context/provider-api, will define the core ContextProvider interface that all providers must implement.

The framework will ship with a suite of essential built-in providers:

@file: Reads the content of a specific file.

@folder: Recursively finds and includes all text files in a directory, respecting .gitignore.

@url: Scrapes a web page and converts its content to clean Markdown.

@git-diff: Provides the output of git diff for a given revision or staged changes.

@repo-map: Generates a high-level, low-token text representation of a codebase, including the file tree and top-level function/class signatures (inspired by Aider).

2.4 Component Distribution: A Git-Native Model
The framework adopts an "Open Code" distribution model for sharing components and workflows, inspired by shadcn/ui. This approach treats Git as the source of truth, avoiding the black-box nature of traditional package managers for configuration recipes.

context add <github-url>: Clones a library of component.toml files into a local .context/libs/ directory for project use.

context pull <component-name>: "Vendors" or "ejects" a specific component from a cloned library into the user's local components/ directory, giving them full ownership to modify and version it.

This system for sharing configurations is distinct from the plugin system for sharing code. New providers (code) are installed as oclif plugins via npm, while new components (TOML files) are shared via Git.

Part 3: The Interfaces: CLI and Visual Builder
3.1 CLI Deep Dive
The CLI is the foundational interface for power users and automation.

Language: TypeScript offers the ideal balance of developer velocity, a massive ecosystem (npm), and "good enough" performance for an I/O-bound tool.

Framework: oclif (Open CLI Framework) is the unequivocal choice. Developed by Salesforce, it is explicitly designed for building extensible CLIs with a first-class, TypeScript-native plugin system. This is the foundational technology that enables the Context Provider model.

Performance Strategy: The framework will employ a dual strategy for optimal performance and safety:

Dual-Compiler Mode: A core feature where context serve (for the visual builder) uses a fast, Rust-based transpiler like SWC to prioritize speed and hot-reloading by skipping type-checking. In contrast, context build invokes the full TypeScript compiler (tsc --noEmit) to guarantee type safety before production.

Application Bundling: For distribution, the entire CLI application will be bundled into a single JavaScript file, eliminating filesystem lookups at runtime and dramatically reducing startup time.

Key Commands:

context init: Initializes a new project, creating context.toml and .vscode/ settings.

context add <github-url>: Adds a component library from a Git repository.

context pull <component-name>: Copies a component from a library into the local project.

context build --target <target-name>: Builds the final context for a specific AI.

context serve: Launches the local Visual Builder.

context plugin:install <npm-package>: Installs a new Context Provider plugin.

3.2 Visual Builder Deep Dive
The Visual Builder lowers the barrier to entry and provides an intuitive workflow for all users.

Architecture: A Tauri desktop application. Unlike a web app, Tauri provides secure access to the local filesystem. Compared to Electron, it offers superior performance, security, and dramatically smaller application bundles by leveraging the OS's native WebView and a Rust-based backend.

Technology Stack:

React: The de facto standard UI library.

React Flow (XyFlow): The industry-leading library for building high-performance, customizable node-based editors.

Zustand: A simple, lightweight state management library. Critically, it is used by React Flow internally and is the library's official recommendation, ensuring seamless integration.

Functionality: The builder acts as a graphical front-end to the Core Engine. Users can drag and drop providers and components onto a canvas, configure them in a properties panel, and see the changes written directly back to their local workflow.toml files in real-time.

Part 4: The Developer Experience (DX) Blueprint
A superior DX is a core product requirement, designed to make the framework indispensable.

4.1 The Art of the Error Message
Errors must be guideposts, not roadblocks. The framework will adopt a "Context, Error, Mitigation" pattern for all user-facing errors. Instead of a generic crash, a helpful, color-coded message will explain what failed, why it failed, and how to fix it, often with a code snippet.

Example Error Message:

Shell

Error: Failed to build workflow 'main.workflow.yaml'.

[Context]
While processing component 'RunProjectTests'.

[Error]
Missing required input: 'framework'.

[Fix]
The 'RunProjectTests' component requires you to specify which testing framework to use. Please provide a value for the 'framework' input in 'main.workflow.yaml':

14 | uses: ./components/run-project-tests.component.toml
15 | with:
16 |   framework = "jest"  <-- Add this line
4.2 The IDE as a Co-Pilot
A rich IDE experience will be delivered through a phased approach:

MVP (Low-Effort, High-Impact): The framework will ship a JSON Schema for its component.toml and workflow.toml files. The context init command will automatically configure VS Code's .vscode/settings.json to associate this schema with the TOML files. This instantly enables validation, autocompletion, and hover-info in any editor with LSP support for TOML (like the Even Better TOML extension for VS Code).

Peak DX (Long-Term Goal): A dedicated Language Server Protocol (LSP) server will be developed. This will provide more advanced, context-aware features, such as autocompleting provider names based on installed plugins or suggesting file paths from the workspace.

4.3 Documentation: The Diátaxis Framework
Documentation is a core product feature. It will be structured using the Diátaxis framework, which organizes content based on the user's need:

Tutorials: Step-by-step lessons for learning (e.g., "Building Your First Custom Provider").

How-To Guides: Goal-oriented recipes for solving specific problems (e.g., "How to Pipe Context to an External Tool").

Explanation: High-level discussions of concepts to build understanding (e.g., "The Philosophy of Context Engineering").

Reference: Technical, descriptive information for quick lookups (e.g., CLI Command Reference, Provider API Spec).

4.4 Project Structure and Onboarding
The project will be a monorepo managed with Turborepo for its high-performance build system and ease of use. A frictionless onboarding process for new contributors will be a priority, featuring a comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md, a single setup script, and curated "good first issue" tickets.
