# Testing Standards

## Testing Framework
- **Mocha + Chai** for unit and integration tests
- Tests located in `test/` directory
- Use `.test.ts` file extension
- Run tests with `npm run test`

## Testing Requirements

### Always End Tasks with Tests
- Every completed task MUST include comprehensive unit tests
- All tests MUST pass before considering task complete
- Tests should cover both success and error scenarios

### Test Structure
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks
- Use `it` blocks for individual test cases

### Test Coverage
- Test all public APIs and exported functions
- Include edge cases and error handling
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test both positive and negative scenarios

## Existing Test Structure
- `test/commands/` - Tests for CLI commands
- `test/unit/` - Unit tests for core functionality
- `test/fixtures/` - Test data and mock files

## Testing Commands
- `npm run test` - Run all tests
- `npm run posttest` - Runs ESLint after tests (automatic)

## Test Configuration
- Configuration in `.mocharc.json`
- TypeScript support configured in `test/tsconfig.json`
