# Task Completion Workflow

Use this rule when working on tasks defined in TASK.md.

## Task Process

1. **Get Context**: Understand the general task based on the **Based on** section in TASK.md
2. **Plan First**: Always plan and consult before starting any task
3. **Single Task Focus**: Complete only one task at a time
4. **Mark Complete**: Update TASK.md with [âœ…] when task is finished

## Task Requirements

### Always Include Tests
- End every task with comprehensive unit tests
- Ensure all tests pass before marking task complete
- Use Mocha + Chai testing framework

### Always Include Documentation  
- Update relevant documentation
- Ensure documentation reflects current functionality
- Keep documentation up to date with changes

### Always Add Summary
- Create a task summary in `task-summaries/` folder
- Add summary reference to the **Summary** section in TASK.md
- Include key decisions, changes made, and lessons learned

## Quality Standards

- All code must be fully functional and working
- No TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces
- Follow TypeScript and oclif best practices
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## File Organization

- Task summaries go in `task-summaries/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames for summaries
- Reference summaries in TASK.md for tracking
